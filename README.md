# DOMinator

This repo aims to introduce you to the basics of JavaScript.

- The `exercises` focus on learning some JavaScript syntax.

- The `demo` folder shows us some basics on manupulating web pages with
  JavaScript.

- Then we're ready to tackle the requirements in the `src` folder.

## Setting up

### Option 1: Work locally

If you have Node already installed, that's great! You can clone and
`npm install` as you normally would.

### Option 2: Codespaces

If you don't have Node installed, not to worry - this repo is set up to work in
Github Codespaces.

Just click the `<> Code` button at the top of this page on github.com, and
create a new Codespace to work in. Everything will install automatically for you
and you can move on to the interesting stuff.

### Option 3: Stackblitz

Codespaces not working out? You could try opening this in Stackblitz:

## Exercises

In the `exercises` folder, you will find some short challenges. In the comments
of each file, there's a link to a video that will help you accomplish each
challenge.

To run the tests, simply type

```bash
# to run all the tests
npm run test

# or a single exercise
npm run test:003
```

## Workshop

During the workshop, you'll be working in the `src` folder.

In your terminal, do

```bash
npm run dev
```

to run the development server, and open the url printed in the console to see
the project in your browser.
